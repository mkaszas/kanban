# kanban

A simple trello clone built with:
- React
- Redux
- Styled components
- react-pose

In this project, I'm exploring redux patterns & localsorage syncing with redux. I'm also building custom animations to explore react-pose (I started it before pose became deprecated in favour of framer motion... Migration should be fairly easy in the future though)
The app is far from complete, but the current version is deployed to: https://kanban.matekaszas.com/
